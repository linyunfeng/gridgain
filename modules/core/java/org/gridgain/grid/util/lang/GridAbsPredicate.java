/**
 * Defines absolute (no-arg) predicate construct. Predicate like closure is a first-class function
 * that is defined with (or closed over) its free variables that are bound to the closure
 * scope at execution.
 * <h2 class="header">Type Alias</h2>
 * To provide for more terse code you can use a typedef {@link P1} class or various factory methods in
 * {@link GridFunc} class. Note, however, that since typedefs in Java rely on inheritance you should
 * not use these type aliases in signatures.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Note that this interface does not impose or assume any specific thread-safety by its
 * implementations. Each implementation can elect what type of thread-safety it provides,
 * if any.
